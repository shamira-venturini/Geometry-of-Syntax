================================================================
TOTAL: 90 Most Common Ergative Verbs from COCA 5000
================================================================

KEY USAGE PATTERNS:

1. Intransitive (No Agent): [THING] + VERB
   → The door opened. (Focus on what happened)

2. Transitive (With Agent): [AGENT] + VERB + [THING]  
   → She opened the door. (Focus on who did it)

3. When to use each pattern:
   • Use INTRANSITIVE when the agent is unknown, unimportant, 
     or when describing a natural process
   • Use TRANSITIVE when the agent is important or specific

Common Mistakes to Avoid:
✗ The door was opened. (Passive - implies someone did it)
✓ The door opened. (Ergative - neutral, no agent implied)

✗ Prices were increased. (Passive - sounds bureaucratic)
✓ Prices increased. (Ergative - more natural in many contexts)
